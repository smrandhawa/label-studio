Most remains of the subspecies were found in southern California , though at least one was discovered in Idaho. It was part of a carnivore guild that included other canids like foxes , gray wolves , and dire wolves. Compared to their modern Holocene counterparts , Pleistocene coyotes were larger and more robust , weighing , likely in response to larger competitors and prey rather than Bergmann 's rule. Their skulls and jaws were significantly thicker and deeper than in modern coyotes , with a shorter and broader rostrum and wider carnassial ( denoting the large upper premolar and lower molar teeth of a carnivore , adapted for shearing flesh ) teeth. These adaptions allowed it to cope with higher levels of stress , when it killed larger prey , compared to modern coyotes. Pleistocene coyotes were also likely more specialized carnivores than their descendants , as their teeth were more adapted to shearing meat , showing fewer grinding surfaces which were better suited for processing vegetation. The lower jaw was also deeper , and the molars showed more signs of wear and breakage than modern populations , thus indicating that the animals consumed more bone than today. Behaviorally , it is likely to have been more social than the modern coyote , as its remains are the third most common in the La Brea Tar Pits , after dire wolves and sabre - toothed cats , both thought to be gregarious species. Their reduction in size occurred within 1,000 years of the occurrence of the Quaternary extinction event , when the climate changed and the majority of their larger prey became extinct. Furthermore , Pleistocene coyotes were unable to successfully exploit the big game hunting niche left vacant after the extinction of the dire wolf , as that gap was rapidly filled by gray wolves. These gray wolves are likely to have actively killed off the larger - bodied coyotes , with natural selection favoring the modern gracile morph.

The males weigh and the females weigh. The coat is white with a red - brown chest and black markings on the forehead and down the length of the nose. The calves are born with a yellow coat without distinguishing marks ; their coats change to adult coloration at 3\u201312 months old. The scimitar oryx formed herds of mixed sexes of up to 70 members , usually guided by the bulls. They inhabited semideserts and deserts and were adapted to live in the extreme heat , with their efficient cooling mechanism and very low requirement of water. Scimitar oryx feed on foliage , grasses , succulent plants and plant parts during the night or early morning. Births peak between March and October. After a gestation of eight to nine months , one calf is born. Soon after , the female has a postpartum estrus. The scimitar oryx was once widespread across northern Africa. Its decline began as a result of climate change during the neolithic period , and later it was hunted extensively for its horns. Today , it is bred in captivity in special reserves in Tunisia , Morocco and Senegal and on private exotic animal ranches in the Texas Hill Country. In 2016 a reintroduction program was launched and currently a small herd has been successfully reintroduced in Chad. The scimitar oryx was domesticated in Ancient Egypt and is believed to have been used as food and sacrificed as offerings to gods. Wealthy people in Ancient Rome also bred them. The use of their valuable hides began in the Middle Ages. The unicorn myth may have originated from sightings of a scimitar oryx with a broken horn.

The silver coin is most often a U.S. half dollar and the copper coin is usually either an English penny or a Mexican centavo. The magician stacks the coins and places them into the spectator 's hand. He then asks her to place her hands behind her back and put one coin in each hand , remarking that the silver coin is slightly larger than the copper coin , making them easy to tell apart. The magician asks to see the silver coin which the spectator produces. When the spectator opens her other hand , the copper coin has become a quarter. The copper coin can then be made to appear wherever the magician desires , such as in the spectator 's pocket or under an object across the room.

He saw this genocide as a two - stage process , the first being the destruction of the indigenous population 's way of life. In the second stage , the newcomers impose their way of life on the indigenous group. According to David Maybury - Lewis , imperial and colonial forms of genocide are enacted in two main ways , either through the deliberate clearing of territories of their original inhabitants in order to make them exploitable for purposes of resource extraction or colonial settlements , or through enlisting indigenous peoples as forced laborers in colonial or imperialist projects of resource extraction. The designation of specific events as genocidal is often controversial. Some scholars , among them Lemkin , have argued that cultural genocide , sometimes called ethnocide , should also be recognized. A people may continue to exist , but if they are prevented from perpetuating their group identity by prohibitions against cultural and religious practices that are the basis of that identity , this may also be considered a form of genocide.

Strains between the Venetian commoners and the nobility , originally stemming from the catastrophic failure of the nobility in the Battle of Porto - Longo against Venice 's long - time rival , Genoa , are largely considered to be the main cause for the coup. However , traditional stories also point to the marriage of Doge Marino Faliero as a possible cause for the coup. Faliero , an 81 year old man , had recently taken a young bride , who was rumored to be engaged in multiple affairs , including with Michele Steno , a Venetian statesman and future Doge. The consistent rumors and apparent intense arrogance of the established Venetian elite seems to have gotten to Faliero in this explanation for a coup. A more reasonable one , however , is that Faliero wished to transform Venice into a dictatorship , mirroring those of Genoa and other northern Italian city - states. This view is , however , disputed by some historians , who cite Faliero 's apparent regret at his trial , and , his lack of mentioning his belief that a dictatorship would better suit Venice 's interests , a valid argument. These two actions are much more consistent with a man regretting a passionate crime , than one who had executed a calculated plan , some argue. The coup was poorly organized and abortive. Faliero convened with two popular , wealthy , public figures who also had quarlles with the noblility : Bertuccio Isarello and Filippo Calendario. After convincing them of the need for a coup , he laid out his plan : Faliero and Isarello would recruit 20 trusted men who would assist in the overthrow of the government , who would each in turn recruit 40 each. However , due to the incredible variability of any given individuals ' reaction to the plan , rumors of unrest quickly began to spread throughout the city and , the Venetian people , fearing the civil turmoil which was swelling up all around them in northern Italy and Byzantium , reported the rumors to the authorities. One of the most powerful governmental bodies of Republican Venice , the Council of Ten , soon convened to discuss the rumors. They became concerned about the Doge 's role in the plot and , exercising emergency powers , together with the Doge 's councillors , the Signori di Notte , and the six sestieri , ordered the immediate and unquestioned arrest of Calendario and Isarello , who , upon questioning , implicated the Doge.
